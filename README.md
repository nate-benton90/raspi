having fun with the custom-made raspberry pi (but more specifically made from here: https://raspberryshake.org/).

To start with, follow these links to complete any preliminary work

1. https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview.
2. If the one above doesn't work for you, just following the same idea but install a basic Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) from here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit.
